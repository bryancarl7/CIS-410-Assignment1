# CIS-410-Assignment1

I think I should have everything necessary for this project, if I have too many files I apologize, it was hard to tell what was necessary and what wasn't.
If you have trouble runnning this at all, please email me at bcarl@uoregon.edu. I tested it locally in a different folder and it ran for me, so hopfully you have the same luck as I!

I should also mention that I accidentally built this on the latest engine and by the time I realized what had happened it was too late.
I know this must change going forward and I fully intend on switching to the older engine but I hope you're willing to overlook it for the first assignment.
I was able to implement the full tutorial as well as the double jump, but my gameside logic was a little sloppy to say the least. 
I wasn't able to implement the WebGL, but It ran inside unity and on pretty much every other build platform.
I shared this file with Eric's CS account as I couldn't find the other two to share with, but since it's a public repository it shouldn't be a problem, but again, please let me know if you have any issues

Best,
Bryan Carl
